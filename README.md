# Match-Engine

To build the executable, simply compile the match_engine executable with make.

After executing, a prompt will appear for file mode (option 'f') or manual mode (option 'm'). A prompt for a filename will appear if option f is chosen. If option m is chosen, prompts for user input will appear (input not validated; format is string,string,int,int)

Input test files are included, as well as the output from a memory leak check.

There is some runtime error which I cannot find; along with the test cases, I had issues with getting my machine to run a debugger and unit tester. Hopefully the comments in the source code explain my logic.
